# Files

- main.py     → Main control script
- camera.py   → Simulates Camera (Device 1)
- backup.py   → Backup Unit (Device 2)
- sos.py      → SOS Alert System

## How It Works

1. Camera runs and may randomly fail.
2. Backup monitors Camera.
3. On failure: Captures images + sends SOS.

# To run the file
python main.py
